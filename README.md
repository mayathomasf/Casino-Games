Objective: In this project, you'll build a Roulette simulation. Players will choose a type of bet and sometimes a specific number, depending on the bet type. The program will then spin a virtual Roulette wheel and land on a number between 1 and 36. Based on the player's bet and the wheel's outcome, the program will determine if the player wins and calculate their earnings. Your goal is to ensure that the game runs smoothly and the payouts are accurate.

Betting Types & Mechanics (Algorithm for each)

Straight Up (Single Number Game):

-This is a bet on a single number.
-If the ball lands on the number you've chosen, you win 35 times your bet. So, if you bet $1, you'd get back your original $1 plus an additional. $35, totaling $36.

Split (Double Number Game):

-This bet is placed on the line between two adjacent numbers on the Roulette table.
-If the ball lands on either of those numbers, you win 17 times your bet. For a $1 bet, you'd receive your original $1 plus an additional $17, totaling $18.

Street (Three Number Game):

-This bet covers three consecutive numbers in a row on the Roulette table.
- If the ball lands on any of those three numbers, you win 11 times your bet. A $1 bet would return your original $1 plus an additional $11, totaling $12.


Top (Numbers 1-18):

-This is a bet that the ball will land on any number from 1 to 18, inclusive.
-If you're correct, you receive a fixed payout of $10 regardless of the specific number. This is irrespective of your initial bet (which is assumed to be $5 based on your description).

Bottom (Numbers 19-36):

-This is a bet that the ball will land on any number from 19 to 36, inclusive.
-If you're correct, you receive a fixed payout of $10, again regardless of the exact number within that range.

Even/Odd:

-You're betting that the ball will land on either an even or an odd number.
-If you're correct, you receive a fixed payout of $10, regardless of which specific even or odd number it lands on.
